This repository contains coursework for a Data Mining class in the Master’s program at the City University of New York, School of Professional Studies.
The course focuses on applying linear regression and binary classification to solve complex analytical problems.

I explore multiple techniques for modeling and prediction, including multiple linear regression and classification methods.
All projects are implemented in the R programming language to effectively address real-world business challenges.

Projects in this repository include:

Moneyball Analysis: Using historical baseball statistics to predict team wins with linear regression.

Crime Classification: Predicting high-crime neighborhoods based on demographic and neighborhood statistics using binary classification models.
